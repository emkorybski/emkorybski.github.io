                            This microblog and our business idea are both dedicated to ozone.<br/>
                            We have high regard for what this mighty little particle is capable of - not only in terms of cleansing sanitizing and purifying but an overall protection it has been serving to life on Earth.<br/> 
                            There will be bits of knowledge here to satisfy everyone - the knowsy, the curious adn the gist readers. On occasion you may get some emoji fun too &#x1F609;. <br/>
                            Despite all our admiration for ozone we will write about facts, and one important of them is that ozone can be dangerous if not handled properly.<br/>Based on science research and our own experiences we are going to explain the dangers and how ozne can become your best friend in handling household sanitation and fighting bad smells like no other substance can.<br/>
                            All quoted publications we will acknowledge accordingly.<br/>

                        <p>
                            It actually already is, at least for past coronaviruses. <br/> 
                            Generally, ozone has been proven to kill almost 100 percent (99.999) of pathogens in the air, including SARS Coronavirus and influenzas such as H5N1.<br/> researchers anticipate that it may be an important tool in preventing the spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)[...]<br/>
                            Quoting CEO of renowned US-based company using ozone for disinfection, Quail Systems LLC:<br/>
                            <em>"This 2019 strand has a similar makeup to SARS; therefore, we anticipate that ozone may kill the new, stronger strand, COVID-19. For decades, we have seen that ozone is the safest and most cost-effective option for protecting people by killing dangerous viruses and other threats."</em><br/>
                            There are good reason for that expectation.<br/>
                            In vast majority of cases viruses are small particles made up of crystals; ozone is proven to destroy a virus by attacking this crystalline nucleic acid core, damaging the viral RNA. <br/>
                            Details of exact chemical reactions happening there are for example described in this <a href="http://nathan.instras.com/MyDocsDB/doc-549.pdf">article</a>.<br/> 

                            COVID-19 is similarly built, it is also known as an enveloped virus - a virus that has a protective layer of proteins on the outside that form in coronavirus's case the trademark 'corona', that helps it attach to other cells.<br/> 
                            In past studies, 99% of viruses hade been destroyed and showed damage to their envelope proteins after 30 seconds of exposure to ozone. This can result in the virus's failure to attach to normal, healthy cells, and the breakdown of the single-stranded RNA can lead to the destruction of the virus.<br/>
                            The above are assumptions to be confirmed with 100% certainty, as for other viruses.<br/>
                            One thing remains certain - your living spaces will be cleansed of 99% of all possible germs including viruses, bacteria and mould during ozoning.<br/>
                            In fact, ozone is now mentioned more and more as very suitable for COVID-19 post-quarantine disinfections.

                            This time without too much science, that you already have had heaps of.<br/><br/>
                            This time it is sharing the purest observation of continental Europe folk living in Ireland for the latest while. So ...<br/><br/>
                            Did you know what the air smells like after Spring storm? Yessss, ozone! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Social isolation and lockdown kept many of us at our smelliest. <br/> The more human presence in a confined space the more germs and resulting 'specific' smell.
                            If you don't already know, bad smell is <element style="text-decoration: underline;">always</element> a sign of something bad starting.
                            So get these old socks out, get the ancient pizza slice from under your bed or perhaps just change your bed sheets.<br/>
                            After that treat yourself to a quick 'deep cleaning for the lazy', what we also call ozone air sanitation. <br/><br/> 
                            And don't get offended, just get in touch. Your household will only be grateful to you.

                        <p>
                            Many things are being said about ozone, especially in the pandemic times - from extreme praise to extreme criticism.<br/>
                            Both sides of the argument highlight subjectively what is suitable for their purpose. <br/>
                            Our objective in this article is to collect and present the pros and cons of using ozone, when it makes sense and when it does not - to allow people to decide for themselves.<br/>
                            Let's start with the basics.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Ozone is the unstable particle made of 3 oxygen atoms as opposed to 2 atoms we would see in a regular stable oxygen particle that we breathe in the air.<br/>
                            This makes ozone very reactive, making it very strong oxidant. And this is where most danger of ozone would come from - its high reactivity leading to peroxidation and effectively destroying lipids in cells. Ozone would act the same way on bacterial viral or fungal cells ason human body cells. Ozone in high concentration <em>is toxic</em> because of the way it reacts not only with organic matter but also artificial chemicals that make up our environment.

                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Chlorine has similar properties as ozone, only much weaker. It lasts much longer in the environment than ozone and these longer exposures (over years of using chlorine-based disinfectant or using a chlorine-sanitized swimming pools) can have much worse poisoning effect than ozone, that takes very short time to break down even if it is not oxidizing. 
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            Now, to the nitty gritty of indoor space sanitation with ozone.<br/>

                            Ozone, when released from ozone-generating machine has a transparent gas form that disperses if given free space, and concentrates when the spece is limited, room sealed off.
                            <br/>
                            For the original toxic concentration to break down significantly, to level that is only irritating for your breathing apparatus but not toxic it takes on average at least 30 minutes is needed (based on the concntration of ozone produced by 7 grams/hour machine in a room of approx. 50 cubic meters).
                            <br/>
                            It is important to realize that ozone is super reactive and it will also react with chemicals from paints, preservants air fresheners and other non-organic substances typically present in our home environment, creating sometimes chemicals that could be dangerous on longer exposure. 
                            It is hard to determine as we have a lot artifcial chemicals around us at home (air fresheners is one of most obvious examples) whether indeed such harmful substance will be created during ozoning so it is considered best practice to start air filtration even during the ozone production process, ideally using purifiers with HEPA filters.
                            This practice - that we adhere to in our sanitation service - ensures that both destroyed organiz matter and neutralized chemicals
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On a general note, our sense of smell in most cases will best tell us when we should not be around ozone as concentration is getting dangerous.<br/>
                            Well-known exception here would be Only exception here would be carbon monoxide, which does not smell and we are at the mercy of it even when the cocnentration is getting toxic.
                            It is totally unline this with ozone. it is similar that way to chlorine.

                            All you will need to do after ozoning is just hoover the floors and wipe surfaces exposed to ozone, to remove a film of neutralized/dead germs spores and particles.

                            Based on professional experience and manuals for ozone generator manufacturers and created by <a class="post-author" href="#">SmellFixers</a>
                        </p>

                        <h4>Effectiveness of ozone</h4>
                        <p>    
                            
                            It has been proven and tested in labs ata molecular level how all kinds of germs and organic chemicals react to ozone and its effectiveness was later calculated based on these tests.<br/>
                            Currently for ozone it is considered that it is capable of destrying/neutralizing 99% of funghi, bacteria and viruses present in the macrobiom of our households.<br/>
                            Ozone is even effective against for example <em>Cryptosporidium</em> fungus that is responsible for infecting our waterways from time to time causing sever outbreaks of diahorrea in people and animals - a feat that chlorine was not able to accomplish.<br/>
                            Of course, preparing a macrobiom for your house is something suboptimal and never done by most of us, accepting the proven power of disinfectants at our displosal.<br/>
                            Similarly, you should start treating ozone as your absolutely most powerful ally in germ-fighting and you can rest assured that - if applied properly - ozone will do its job as no chlorine or alcohol based disinfectant can.                        
                        </p>
                        <h4>Toxicity and how do you prevent ozone poisoning?</h4>
                        <p> 
                            It is not difficult to handle ozone properly and in most situations when using concentrated ozone as disinfectant in your household, you don't need a measurement tool or counter to stay safe and get the most from your ozone treatment.<br/>
                            Many of us already have anti-smog or surgical masks that are being used during the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.<br/>
                            These masks can be a good protection if you are entering a space where there is ozone in toxic concentration - you simply will not have to jump in quickly but omfortably adjust your air purifier or ozone generator program settings.<br/>
                            <br/> 
                            If the exposure to concentrated ozone is very short, i.e. less than 30 seconds then such mask or covering your nose and mouth tightly should suffice.<br/>
                            If you have to stay in a space where ozone is in high and toxic concentration than using a mask with active coal filter is a must.<br/>
                            Remember that even small concentrations of ozone that are higher than normal may cause irritation (so strictly speaking cause no damage but cause shortness of breathing and make you cough).<br/>
                            Ozone has a very specific smell and is easy to detect - when concentration is getting larger your breating apparatus and will certainly tell you that.

                            Based on professional experience and manuals for ozone generator manufacturers and created by <a class="post-author" href="#">SmellFixers</a> <!--<a class="post-category post-category-design" href="#">CSS</a> <a class="post-category post-category-pure" href="#">Pure</a> -->

                        <p>
                            We recommend - after the equipment producers - to start slowly, form a cycle of 10-30 minutes in a typical small room (of up to 10 sq. meters), then let the amassed ozone concentration work its way in on the surface and in the air for an hour.<br/>
                            Repeat the cycle a couple of times changing the location of the ozone generator so the ozone stream (all our equipment has 1-direction fans) works on all points of concern in the room.<br/>
                            The 10-30 minutes should typically suffice in most situations and it also ensures no overly toxic cocnentration for humans will amass in the room space, at the same time being enough to destroy germs present in the air or on surfaces. This duration is also what most of our generators were designed to run for. 
                            <ol>
                                <li>Set first run to maximum 30 minutes - the smaller the room (below 5 sq. meters the less time you need, with minimum of 10 minutes.</li>
                                <li>After the first run pre-programmed machine will stop and you should not enter the room for a minumum of another 30 mins, the bigger the room the more time you should leave for ozone to break down and decrease the toxicity level to tolerable.</li>  
                                <li>After that wait time you may enter the room to open windows and let the air in to further dissolve ozone.<br/>
                                You should do this in a mask (and always in a mask if you suffer from asthma) - surgical or even cotton mask with a few layers should suffice. Once you have mask you can stay in the room longer, wipe and clean surfaces or hoover.</li>
                                <li>After about 45-60 mins of ventilation you can reapeat the cycle again, form a different corener of the room if you wish or the are hidden space where you suspect ozon have not penetrated.</li>   
                            </ol>
                            Usually one cycle per small room (of up to 50 cubic meters) should suffice.

                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            Every once in a while, treating your home or business space where people gather (such as coffee shop or restaurant) with ozone, will guarantee <b>effective cleansing</b> of bacteria viruses and mould spores, <b>fixing bad smells</b> at the same time.
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            We have significant personal experience in using Ozone in our own homes and we understand the safest possible way of handling it so that it brings the added value of purified and refreshed air to your premises. We can fully recommend it as a solution to bad smell problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hiring ozone generator from us is the most effective to disinfect or deodorize your premises.
